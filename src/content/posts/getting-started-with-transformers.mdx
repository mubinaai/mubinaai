Transformers are now the default architecture for most state-of-the-art natural language systems.

## Why transformers changed everything

The key shift was replacing recurrence with attention, allowing models to process tokens in parallel and learn long-range relationships.

### Core attention intuition

Self-attention lets each token weigh every other token before producing its representation.

```ts
export function scaledDotProduct(q: number, k: number, d: number) {
  return (q * k) / Math.sqrt(d);
}
```

> Strong results come from architecture plus robust data and evaluation discipline.

## Practical usage tips

Start with proven open-source models, benchmark on your own dataset, and optimize inference cost early.
