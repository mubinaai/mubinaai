AI services need a wider observability surface than conventional APIs.

## Track quality and performance together

Quality drift and latency regressions often appear at the same time.

### Minimum telemetry set

Log prompts, model versions, response quality labels, latency, token usage, and failure reasons.

```json
{
  "requestId": "req_124",
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "latencyMs": 842,
  "tokens": 1920
}
```

## Alert on meaningful thresholds

Alert fatigue is real, so align thresholds with product impact and user-visible failures.
